I. Background of the project
 
Clinic management system and services is designed to provide solutions to your daily clinical task such as organizing numerous data about the patient information database, patient history, patient treatment history, laboratory results, anatomy, diagnosis, prescription, medical certificates, daily sales, payment and others.
Basically, patients spend a substantial amount of time in clinics waiting for services to be delivered by the doctor or health professionals. And we all know that as the number of patients continually increases, managing a clinic can also become increasingly difficult, especially if everything is done manually.
 
A.	Statement of the Problem
The clinic services experienced a problem in keeping a hard copy and a printed document of their respective patient.
Walk-in patients waiting outside the clinic for their turn to be checked-up and to get their respective schedule for their personal checkup.
The doctor is dependent with their secretary in tracking the patient history of the client.
Immediate issuance of the medical certificates of the patient takes longer to release because it needs the actual presence of the doctor for the details and signature.
 
 B.     Solution of the Problem
The solution to these problems is to make a website that is capable of keeping data online instead of storing it in the filing cabinet.
A website that is able to accept patient booking schedules for personal check-up.
This website can search, sort and print data from the database without the help of the secretary or staff.
A website that is able to print and send files to the respective patients with the details and signature of the doctor.
 

II. Features of the Project
        	The proposed project is an effective replacement of the current manual procedures of the clinic services. This will give a better result and efficient performance with the following features given below:
•      Secured access only to those authorized personnel.
•      List of daily patient and patient history.
•      Integrated patient record from secretary, doctor and up to releasing.
•      Print patient data information.
•      Print patient history.
•      Print patient prescription.
•      Print medical certificates.
•      Real-time scheduling
•      Customize upon request.
 
III. Limitations of the Project
        	In general, the focus of this study is directed towards the design and development of an online clinic management system. 
In this proposed system, records and files are computerized and stored online for accessibility and portability.  However, the proponents limit the online feature of the system to doctors and staff only.  Web-access of the patients is included but limited only for booking schedule.  The system has a secure log-in for doctors and staff but billing statements and official receipts are not included in the system.
You may also encounter data privacy since all information on the web is not 100% secure.
